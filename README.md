### Steps performed:

1. Preparing Dataset:
   Convert dicom files into nifties
   NIfTI is a more widely supported format than DICOM, allowing the data to be opened and analyzed.

2. Batching images silces
   Creating groups of slices(each layer of the volumetric image data)
   Perfomed transformations: Scale intensity, Crop Foreground, orientation, etc.

3. Train U-Net model:
   A U-Net model is traine with Pytorch framework.

   Dice loss is calculated
   Dice Loss = 1 - 2 * (Sum of (Predicted * Ground Truth)) / (Sum of Predicted + Sum of Ground Truth)
